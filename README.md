# Ansible CIS Debian 12 Hardening

## Purpose

Configure Debian 12 machines to be [CIS](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/) compliant. 

Note: this role will make changes to the system that could break things. This is not an auditing tool but rather a remediation tool to be used after an audit has been conducted.

CIS hardened Debian: cyber attack and malware prevention for mission-critical systems
CIS benchmarks lock down your systems by removing:
1. non-secure programs.
2. disabling unused filesystems.
3. disabling unnecessary ports or services.
4. auditing privileged operations.
5. restricting administrative privileges.


CIS benchmark recommendations are adopted in virtual machines in public and private clouds. They are also used to secure on-premises deployments. For some industries, hardening a system against a publicly known standard is a criteria auditors look for. CIS benchmarks are often a system hardening choice recommended by auditors for industries requiring PCI-DSS and HIPPA compliance, such as banking, telecommunications and healthcare.
If you are attempting to obtain compliance against an industry-accepted security standard, like PCI DSS, APRA or ISO 27001, then you need to demonstrate that you have applied documented hardening standards against all systems within the scope of assessment.


The Debian CIS benchmarks are organised into different profiles, namely **‘Level 1’** and **‘Level 2’** intended for server and workstation environments.


**A Level 1 profile** is intended to be a practical and prudent way to secure a system without too much performance impact.
* Disabling unneeded filesystems,
* Restricting user permissions to files and directories,
* Disabling unneeded services.
* Configuring network firewalls.

**A Level 2 profile** is used where security is considered very important and it may have a negative impact on the performance of the system.
* Creating separate partitions,
* Auditing privileged operations

The Debian CIS hardening tool allows you to select the desired level of hardening against a profile (Level1 or Level 2) and the work environment (server or workstation) for a system.
For example:
```Bash
ansible-playbook -i inventory cis-Debian-20.yaml --tags="level_1_server"
```
You can list all tags by running the below command:
```Bash
ansible-playbook -i host run.yaml --list-tags
```


Based on
```Text
CIS Debian Linux 12 Benchmark
v1.0.0 - 02-13-2020
```

Requirements
------------

You should carefully read through the tasks to make sure these changes will not break your systems before running this playbook.

You can download Free CIS Benchmark book from this URL
[Free Benchmark](https://learn.cisecurity.org/benchmarks)


To start working in this Role you just need to install Ansible.
[Installing Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)


_________________

Role Variables
--------------

You have to review all default configuration before running this playbook, there are many role variables defined in defaults/main.yml.

* If you are considering applying this role to any servers, you should have a basic familiarity with the CIS Benchmark and an appreciation for the impact that it may have on a system.
* Read and change configurable default values.

Examples of config that should be immediately considered for exclusion:

**5.2.18 Ensure SSH access is limited**, which by default effectively limit access to the host (including via ssh).

**For example:**

* CIS-Debian12-Ansible/defaults/main.yml
```YAML

#Section 5
# 5.2.18 Ensure SSH access is limited
allowed_users: pippo #Put None or list of users space between each user

```

Also consider skipping tag 1.1.1.7 (Ensure mounting of FAT filesystems is limited): the FAT filesystem format is used by UEFI systems for the EFI boot partition.

If you need you to change file templates, you can find it under `templates/*` directory
If you need to change banner, edit banner file in `files/*` directory

_________________

Dependencies
------------

* Ansible version >= 2.9

_________________

Example Playbook
----------------

Below an example of a playbook

```Yaml
---
- hosts: host1
  become: yes
  remote_user: root
  gather_facts: yes
  roles:
    - { role: "CIS-Debian12-Ansible",}
```

### Run all
If you want to run all tags use the below command:
```Bash
ansible-playbook -i [inventoryfile] [playbook].yaml
```
### Dry Run 
```Bash
ansible-playbook -i host -C playbook.yaml 
```
### Run specfic section
```Bash
ansible-playbook -i host playbook.yaml -t section2
```
### Run multi sections
```Bash
ansible-playbook -i host playbook.yaml -t section2 -t 6.1.1
```
* Note:
When run an individual task be sure from the dependencies between tasks, for example, if you run tag **4.1.1.2 Ensure auditd service is enabled** before running **4.1.1.1 Ensure auditd is installed** you will get an error at the run time.
